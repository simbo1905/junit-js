JUnit Runner for Javascript Tests using Nashorn or Rhino

Note that the tests which should fail are commented out; this lets you get a build where you can set breakpoints to see 
what is going on. It will also let the maven build pass to be able to deploy this project.

Test suites go under src/test/java and they name test scripts which go into src/test/resources.
